# Deploying OpenTelemetry Demo

This folder contains additional configuration for deploying the
OpenTelemetry Shop Demo on Sentry's infrastructure. We're using
[the official OpenTelemetry Helm chart](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/opentelemetry-demo)
to deploy the demo on our Kubernetes cluster.

## Available Resources

We have two environments at the moment, each having its own set of supporting services.

**Note**: all links are currently accessible by Sentry employees only.

### Staging

This environment used for development and testing.

- Webstore: <https://otel-demo-staging.testa.getsentry.net/>
- Grafana: <https://otel-demo-staging.testa.getsentry.net/grafana/>
- Feature Flags UI: <https://otel-demo-staging.testa.getsentry.net/feature/>
- Load Generator UI: <https://otel-demo-staging.testa.getsentry.net/loadgen/>
- Jaeger UI: <https://otel-demo-staging.testa.getsentry.net/jaeger/ui/>

### Production

This environment can be used for demos, and should be considered "stable".

- Webstore: <https://otel-demo.testa.getsentry.net/>
- Grafana: <https://otel-demo.testa.getsentry.net/grafana/>
- Feature Flags UI: <https://otel-demo.testa.getsentry.net/feature/>
- Load Generator UI: <https://otel-demo.testa.getsentry.net/loadgen/>
- Jaeger UI: <https://otel-demo.testa.getsentry.net/jaeger/ui/>

## Configuration Files

You can edit the following files in this directory:

- [`meta.yaml`](./meta.yaml) -- contains various meta configuration about the
  deployment, e.g. the currently used version of the Helm chart.
- [`sentry-components.yaml`](./sentry-components.yaml) -- a list of components
  that have Sentry instrumentation. If some service there is commented out, that
  means that the vanilla version of the service (meaning, a prebuilt Docker image)
  will be started.
- [`global.yaml`](./global.yaml) -- overrides for the
  [Helm chart that is used to deploy the demo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/opentelemetry-demo).
  Here you can configure things like allocated CPU/memory for each service.

### Enable Sentry Instrumentation

To enable Sentry instrumentation for the component, do the following:

1. Uncomment the service section in [`sentry-components.yaml`](./sentry-components.yaml)
   and provide attribute overrides, if necessasry.
2. Configure additional non-public parameters (e.g. SENTRY_DSN environment variable)
    <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
   [in this file](https://github.com/getsentry/test-factory/blob/main/k8s/services/workflows-otel-demo/templates/otel-demo/services-secrets.yaml)
   (private repository).

## (Re)Deploying Changes

At the moment we maintain two demo environments:

- Staging: <https://otel-demo-staging.testa.getsentry.net/>
- Production: <https://otel-demo.testa.getsentry.net/>

The environments can be redeployed via our [instance of Argo Workflows](https://run.testa.getsentry.net/).
It works as follows:

1. Go to <https://run.testa.getsentry.net/> (internal-only).
2. Click "+ Submit New Workflow" in the upper left corner.
3. Select "opentelemetry-demo-deploy" workflow.
4. Specify the git revision (branch, commit, etc.) of <https://github.com/getsentry/opentelemetry-demo>
   repository that you want to deploy.
5. Change the environment via the dropdown, if necessary.
6. Click `+ Submit`.

In a few minutes the environment will be recreated.

**Note**: at the moment we don't persist any data between redeploys.
